## [Coopr](http://cask.co): Modern Cluster Management

Coopr is cluster management software that manages clusters on public, private
clouds. Clusters created with Coopr utilize templates of any hardware and
software stack, from simple standalone LAMP-stack servers and traditional application
servers like JBoss, to full Apache Hadoop clusters comprised of thousands of nodes.
Clusters can be deployed across many cloud providers (Rackspace, Joyent, and OpenStack)
while utilizing common SCM tools (Chef and scripts).


## Releases

### Current:
   * [Codename: Ursa Major, 0.9.9](http://docs.cask.co/coopr/0.9.9/en/release-notes/index.html)

### Older:
   * [Codename: Centaurus, Theme: multi-tenancy, 0.9.8](http://docs.cask.co/coopr/0.9.8/en/release-notes/index.html)

## Getting Started

You can build a standalone version of Coopr that will run on your machine. It requires Java 6 or Java 7 to run the server, Node v0.10.26 or higher for the UI, and Ruby 1.9.0p0 or higher for the provisioner.
```
  > git clone https://github.com/cdapio/coopr.git
  > cd coopr/coopr-standalone
  > git submodule init
  > git submodule update
  > mvn clean package assembly:single -DskipTests
```

The build places a zip of the standalone version of Coopr into the target directory. Unzip it and follow the instructions in the README.md file to start up Coopr on your own machine. It comes pre-packaged with templates for CDAP, Docker, Hadoop, LAMP, MEAN and MongoDB. In order to create an actual cluster, you will need an account with a supported provider (AWS, DigitalOcean, Google, Joyent, Openstack or Rackspace), and perform a couple steps to setup up Coopr to use the right credentials to integrate with your provider. Follow the [Quickstart Guide](http://docs.coopr.io/coopr/current/en/guide/quickstart/index.html#getting-started), which steps through an example of adding workers to your tenant, configuring a provider, and creating a Hadoop cluster.
