# Contributing to Coopr

Are you interested in making Coopr better? Our development model is a simple
pull-based model with a consensus building phase, similar to the Apache's voting process.
If you want to help make Coopr better, by adding new features, fixing bugs, or
even suggesting improvements to something that's already there, here's how you can
contribute:

 * Fork Coopr into your own GitHub repository
 * Create a topic branch with an appropriate name
 * Work on your favorite feature to your content
 * Once you are satisifed, create a pull request by going to the cdapio/coopr project.
 * Address all the review comments
 * Once addressed, the changes will be committed to the cdapio/coopr repo.

If you are planning a large change or contribution, discuss your plans on the coopr-dev mailing list first. This will help us understand your needs and guide your solution in a way that best fits the project.
Bugs and suggestions should be made by filing a [JIRA](https://issues.cask.co/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa)
against this project.
