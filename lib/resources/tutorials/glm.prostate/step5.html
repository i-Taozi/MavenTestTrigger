<p>Now that we have loaded the prostate dataset into H<sub>2</sub>O, we can build a
Generalized Linear Model.  For this purpose, please use the menu
option <span class='label mref'>Model &gt; GLM</span> or direct <a
href="/2/GLM2.query?source=prostate.hex&response=CAPSULE&family=binomial&destination_key=GLMmodel"
target="_blank">link</a>.
<p>
</p>
GLM has multiple tuning parameters that can affect the model it will build.
For example, you can change the general model family to binomial (logistic
regression) or guassian or poisson, change the amount of L1 and L2
regularization, or alter which column from the dataset the model is predicting.
