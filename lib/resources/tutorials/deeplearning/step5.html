<p>Now that we have loaded the prostate dataset into H<sub>2</sub>O, we can build a
Deep Learning model.  For this purpose, please use the menu
option <span class='label mref'>Model &gt; Deep Learning</span> or direct <a

Deep Learning has a rich set of tuning parameters that can affect the training speed and model performance.
