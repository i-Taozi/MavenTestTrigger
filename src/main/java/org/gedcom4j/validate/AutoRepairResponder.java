/**
 * <p>
 * The interface for an AutoRepairResponder.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the gedcom4j {@link Validator} class has a finding that it is able to automatically repair, it will call the
 * {@link #mayRepair(Validator.Finding)} method on the auto-repair validator that is registered in the {@link Validator} class. If
 * that implementation returns true, the auto-repair will proceed...otherwise, it won't.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Built-in implementations exist to allow everything ({@link Validator#AUTO_REPAIR_ALL}) and to allow nothing
 * ({@link Validator#AUTO_REPAIR_NONE}) to be auto-repaired. You can also write your own implementation if you want to be more
 * selective. You will need to implement this interface, and your implementation should examine the {@link Validator.Finding} passed
 * in on the callback to decide whether to return true (to permit the repair) or false (to forbid the repair).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that since the finding passed to the responder has a reference to the object with the finding, the caller has the
 * opportunity do do its own corrections to the object if it wants, and then return false to indicate that the framework should not
 * attempt any further repairs to the object.
