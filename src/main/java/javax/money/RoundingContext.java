 * This class models the spec/configuration for a rounding, modeled as {@link javax.money.MonetaryRounding} in a

 * to the {@link javax.money.spi.RoundingProviderSpi} that must of the according rounding instance. The
 * <i>default</i> <code>roundingId</code> is <code>default</code>.
 * <p>
 * A RoundingContext can take up arbitrary attributes that must be documented by the
 * {@link javax.money.spi.RoundingProviderSpi} implementations.
 * <p>
 * Examples for such additional attributes are
 * {@link java.math.RoundingMode}, {@link java.math.MathContext}, additional regional information,
 * e.g. if a given rounding is targeting cash rounding.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable, serializable, thread-safe.
