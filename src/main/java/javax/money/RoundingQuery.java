/**
 * Query for accessing instances of {@link javax.money.MonetaryRounding}. In general it is determined by the
 * implementation, what roundings are provided. Nevertheless the following queries must be supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Accessing roundings using rounding names and/or regular expressions.</li>
 * <li>Accessing mathematical rounding by setting a scale and (optionally) a {@link java.math.MathContext} as
 * additional generic attribute.</li>
 * <li>Accessing default roundings for a {@link javax.money.CurrencyUnit}. This method should return the most
 * appropriate rounding for a currency. If no
 * currency specific rounding is available, it should return a rounding with {@code scale==currency
 * .getDefaultFractionUnits(), java.math.RoundingMode = RoundingMode.HALF_EVEN}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * All other roundings including cash rounding and historical roundings are optional.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable, thread-safe and serializable.
