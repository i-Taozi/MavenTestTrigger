/**
 * A unit of currency.
 * <p>
 * This interface represents a unit of currency such as the British Pound, Euro,
 * US Dollar, Bitcoin or other. It provides interoperability between different
 * implementations.
 * <p>
 * Currencies can be distinguished by separate {@link #getCurrencyCode()} codes,
 * similar to {@link java.util.Currency}.
 * <h3>Implementation specification</h3>
 * Implementation of this class
 * <ul>
 * <li>are required to implement {@code equals/hashCode} considering the
 * concrete implementation type and currency code.</li>
 * <li>are required to be thread-safe</li>
 * <li>are required to be immutable</li>
 * <li>are required to be comparable</li>
 * <li>should be serializable (on platforms providing serialization).</li>
