# Concepts

Programming by contract is a simple, yet powerful, technique to achieve assertive programming.
The basic idea of valid4j is to make a clear distinction between _programming errors_ and 
_recoverable exceptions_. Programming errors are not recoverable exceptions and should not
be handled as such.

### Programming errors

Programming errors are usually the result of an oversight of assumptions that really doesn't hold.
This may result in logical contradictions, like trying to use a non-existent object 
(e.g. `NullPointerException`) or invoking a method with an incomprehensible argument 
(e.g. `IllegalArgumentException`).

Logical errors must be corrected at design time. It doesn't make sense to `try` illogical
invocations in order to `catch` and recover from them. But we still want our programs to detect, 
expose and locate these bugs. Programming by contract gives us a technique to do just that.

### Recoverable exceptions

Recoverable exceptions, on the other hand, signal exceptional cases that a correct program can and
should handle gracefully. This might be network connection errors, file system errors or data input
validation errors. This is what we in everyday talk refer to as error handling, fault tolerance and the like.
  
According to the usage guidelines of the Java exception hierarchy, as a general rule programming errors 
should inherit from `RuntimeException` whereas `Error` is reserved for internal errors of the Java 
runtime system. However, there is also differing opinions in the Java community regarding the proper 
use of checked vs unchecked exceptions. This has led to the widespread use of `RuntimeException` also 
for recoverable exceptions.

Valid4J prefers to use `Error` to signal programming errors, and is agnostic to the question of
using `Exception` (checked) or `RuntimeException` (unchecked) for recoverable exceptions.

# Defensive programming, don't do it

...a common, but sad example... 
  
    // Example of client code with sad defensive programming
    Object someParam;
    ...
    Stuff result = supplier.method(someParam);
    if (result == null) {
      // Some error handling
    } else if (supplier.getState() == GREAT) {
      result.doWork();
    } else {
      // Some more error handling
    }


    // Example of supplier code with sad defensive programming
    public Stuff method(Object param) {
      Stuff r;
      if (param == null) {
        // Some error handling
      } else if (getState() == GOOD) {
        r = a.doStuff();
      } else {
        // Even more error handling
      }
      return r;

The characteristic of the above code is that no one knows their responsibilities. No one 
knows what they are supposed to do or what others are supposed to do. Code is recognized 
by "maybe"/"perhaps"/"if you're lucky" statements, obscuring the real semantics
and valid error handling. Are there any programming errors hidden in this code? How do I
know? Defensive programming hides programming errors in a bloat of code and - which is worse - 
are handled as ordinary recoverable errors! Programming errors should not be dealt with this way.
Fail fast and don't let programming errors go undetected.

# Programming by contracts

The principle of design by contract is to clarify the responsibilities of the calling side 
(client) and the corresponding responsibilities of the called side (supplier). Delegating 
responsibilities is key to all good design. We do this by specifying which conditions must 
be met by the client, and which conditions must be met by the supplier.

![The agreement](images/handshake.jpg "Handshake")

A violation of the precondition means that the client has not fulfilled the contract, hence 
there is a programming error on the client side. The client is _required_ to make sure the 
preconditions hold before calling a method.

A violation of the postcondition means that the supplier has not fulfilled the contract, 
hence there is a programming error on the supplier side. The supplier _ensures_ that the 
postcondition holds before returning from a method.

By using the mechanism of contracts, bugs in the software are instantly exposed as soon as 
they are detected in runtime. A contract violation means that an assumption in the 
software doesnâ€™t hold. This means we are executing in an unknown state. 

Never try to catch and recover from a contract violation. A bug-free application should
not rely on contracts being evaluated at all. A reasonable approach would be to abort the 
application, possibly followed with some kind of global recovery, like restarting the 
application, returning a HTTP 500 response or similar. 

### Require contracts (preconditions)

* The clients' responsibility. What the client is _required_ to fulfill.
* Expresses what has to be fulfilled before a method may be called.
* Expressed as condition(s) on the state of the supplier, and/or input parameters.

### Ensure contracts (postconditions)

* The suppliers' responsibility. What the supplier _ensures_ will be fulfilled.
* Expresses what is fulfilled after the method has executed.
* Expressed as condition(s) on the state of the supplier, and/or return values.
* Recoverable exception(s) may be thrown in those cases where the method can not
  fulfill its postcondition(s). (This is error handling, not contracts...)
  
### Invariants

* Expresses what is always fulfilled for an object.
* **Important**: Must hold _even if_ a recoverable exception is thrown!
* This is trickier than it seems... Be careful - dragons be here!

Prefer immutable classes and check invariants at exit of constructor. This 
is a much simpler special case of invariants.

# Assertive programming

Using contracts it's easy to see what assumptions we can rely on and which 
conditions we are to achieve. The readability of the code is improved. Any if-else
statements or try-catch clauses deal with proper error handling and fault tolerance, 
not programming errors. Code to the point!

Contractual assumptions are evaluated at runtime and any violations will immediately
be detected, exposed and located which greatly speeds up and simplifies bug fixing. 
Slow, boring and tedious debugging is not needed any more.

    // Example of assertive client code
    Stuff result = supplier.method(someParam);
    result.doWork();

    // Example of assertive supplier code
    public Stuff method(Object param) {
      require(param, notNullValue());
      require(getState(), equalTo(GOOD));
      ...
      ensure(getState(), equalTo(GREAT));
      return ensure(r, notNullValue());
    }

Beneficial side effects of using contracts is that it

* encourages the use of a single exit/return statement where the ensure contract 
  may be checked. Several return statements, each checking the postcondition, would 
  clutter the code and be error prone.
* makes it obvious for the programmer to reason about what recoverable exceptions 
  could occur when executing the code, i.e. the cases when the ensure contracts 
  cannot be fulfilled.

# Good manners to keep

Easy! Right? If we are using contracts to clarify the responsibilities between clients and suppliers 
there are a couple of things to keep in mind. 

### Separate queries from commands

There are two types of methods in the world:

* Commands/mutators - methods that change the program state in any way.
* Queries/accessors - methods that do not change the program state. These are side-effect free functions. 

We should separate commands from queries. Our methods should have a single 
well-defined responsibility. Either they are commands, methods that change 
the current state of our program. Or they are queries, side-effect free methods 
that just return a result. Evaluating and verifying contracts shall not change the 
(perceived) program state. (Perceived that is; like acquiring & releasing a mutex 
may be ok, caching may be ok.)

Why? Goes without saying! Contracts are a part of the specification, not the semantics. 
The outcome of a contract check must not depend on how many times it has been 
checked (if any). A bug-free application should not rely on contracts being evaluated at all.

Only use queries in contract evaluations. Never use commands in contract evaluations.

### Provide a complete (and usable) interface for clients

Specifying preconditions is the same as putting requirements on our clients. We are
essentially demanding them to fulfill their responsibilities. Make sure they also
have the _possibility_ to achieve that.

    public class BadManners {
      public BadManners(int i) {
        require(isValid(i)); // Never use private methods in contracts!!
                             // ...makes the class pretty useless
      }
      private static boolean isValid(int i) { ... }
    }

When specifying contracts, provide clients with a public interface to make it possible 
for them to fulfill their obligations. Using private methods as a contract specification
makes the class pretty useless. No client can fulfill their responsibilities if it's not 
possible for them to check if they actually _have_ fulfilled them.

# Contracts vs. error handling

Contracts is not error handling! Error handling is not contracts!

Use contracts to ensure the correctness of a program. Contracts are used to detect logical 
errors or internal contradictions, making sure that the collaborating classes that constitute
the program fulfill their obligations. Do not use contracts to deal with situations that
couldn't be considered to be in our control, like invalid user input, network connection errors, 
or file system issues. Contracts are no substitute for proper error handling and recovery.

![Contracts is not validation](images/contracts-and-validation.png "Contracts != Validation")

Use error handling to ensure the robustness of a program. To deal with exceptional cases
outside our control, like erroneous user input or failed network connections, we need
error handling. Do not use error handling to deal with logical errors, i.e. programming errors.

    // Example of using contracts when creating new instances of Country
    public class Country {
    
      // Use contract to specify that it is the _clients_ responsibility
      // to make sure only valid country codes are given to the constructor.
      // Invoking this constructor with an invalid country code is considered
      // to be a programming error on the clients part.
      public Country(String code) {
        require(isValidCountryCode(code));
        // 
      }
    
      // Make method available (i.e public) for clients to use, making it possible
      // for them to fulfill their part of the contract
      public static boolean isValidCountryCode(String code) {
        // ...
      }
    }

The above code is an example on how to use contracts to push a responsibility to
the client. A client which doesn't fulfill the contract has a programming error.

Below is the same code using a technique of error handling instead.

    // Example of using error handling when creating new instances of Country
    public static class Country {
    
      // Define a recoverable exception for clients to catch and recover from
      public static class InvalidCountryCodeException extends RuntimeException {}
    
      // Use error handling to throw a recoverable exception in the case an
      // invalid country code is supplied to the constructor. A proper client 
      // will have to catch and recover from such an exception should it occur.
      public Country(String code) {
        validate(isValidCountryCode(code), new InvalidCountryCodeException());
      
      }
    
      // Validation code may or may not be available for clients to use directly.
      private static boolean isValidCountryCode(String code) {
        // ...
      }
    }
    
How do we choose between using contracts and/or error handling? As a designer of a 
class we can decide how much responsibility we can and will put on our clients. 
What is the anticipated usage of the class? Is it possible to require clients
to fulfill certain tasks? 

A guideline to bear in mind is that in a bug-free application, the contract checking
should be possible to switch off. (_Possible_ that is; we are not recommending to switch 
them off, though, nota bene.) Proper error handling can not be switched off since there 
will be clients that rely on recoverable exceptions being thrown when exceptional conditions
occur.

Also remember that (recoverable) exceptions should be used for exceptional cases, 
not the normal flow in a program.

# Contracts and inheritance

When using contracts in inherited classes, remember the [Liskov Substititution 
Principle (LSP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle).
It states that, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced 
with objects of type S. Think, S is-a T.

![Contracts and inheritance](images/contracts-and-lsp.png "LSP")

In regards to contracts this means that a subclass must not require more from 
its client, than the base class. And a subclass must not ensure less to its 
client, than the base class.

Therefore:

* Subclasses may have the same or weaker preconditions (as the base class), but not stronger.
* Subclasses may have the same or stronger postconditions (as the base class), but not weaker.

# Contracts and multi-threading

The first rule of multi-threading: avoid shared mutable state!

That being said, if we want to use contracts on shared mutable objects, we 
can't put preconditions on the current supplier *state*. This is because, in a 
multi-threaded environment there is no way for a client to make sure that such 
a condition holds before making the call (effectively making the class pretty 
useless).

![Contracts and multi-threading](images/contracts-and-multi-threading.png "Multi-threading")

One option would be to throw a (recoverable) exception if the condition is
not satisfied. In such an event the client could just catch and recover from
the failure.

    // Example of throwing a recoverable exception
    validate(myState == GOOD_STATE, new InvalidStateException());

Another option would be to require the client to acquire exclusive access to
the object prior to any invocations. If so, put contract on this!

    // Example of precondition to acquire exclusive access before invocation
    require(Thread.holdsLock(this));
    require(myState == GOOD_STATE);
    
Preconditions on input *arguments* is the same in a multi-threaded 
environment as in a single-threaded environment (assuming they themselves 
arenâ€™t modified by multiple threads...).
  
# Contracts and unit testing

Contracts and unit testing complement each other. 

Contracts capture the general semantic of a method, e.g. addition: result == a+b, 
whereas unit tests verify a specific execution path, e.g. scenario: 3 == 1+2.

Contracts are written into the production code, whereas unit tests give
an example of proper usage in non-production code.

Contracts are enforced during unreliable live execution, whereas unit tests 
exercise the code in a safe test environment. So, make sure to leave
the contracts switched on, even in production.

Contracts specify the space of allowed invocations of a method, by specifying
which conditions must be satisfied prior to invocation. This knowledge may be 
used to exclude the "out-of-specification" space from what is unit tested, 
making the testing effort concentrate on the space in-specification.
