    <faq id="unit-test-instead-of-contracts">
      <question>
        I use unit-testing. What's the point of contracts?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>Unit-testing only detect errors for the test-cases that have been written, when they
        are executed in a controlled test environment. Contracts detect errors also when the
        code is running live in the wild.</p>

    <faq id="recover-from-contract-violations">
      <question>
        Why shouldn't I try to catch and recover from a contract violation?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>You're doing it wrong if you do. A require violation implies a bug at
          the calling client side. You should correct the bug at the calling side, thereby
          preventing the violation to happen in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>An ensure violation implies a bug at the supplier side. The supplier does not
        live up to their obligations. You should correct the bug at the supplier side. If the
        supplier can not live up to their promises, throw a recoverable exception instead, that
        the client can catch and recover from.
