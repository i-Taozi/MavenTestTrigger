Immutable Collections

  There are a few classes that are truly immutable (not like those
  pseudo immutables from Guava and Apache Commons):

   * {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/immutable/Array.html}<<<Array>>>}}:
   implements {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html}<<<Collection>>>}};

   * {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/immutable/ArraySet.html}<<<ArraySet>>>}}:
   implements {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Set.html}<<<Set>>>}};

   * {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/immutable/ArraySortedSet.html}<<<ArraySortedSet>>>}}:
   implements {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html}<<<SortedSet>>>}};

   * {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/immutable/ArrayMap.html}<<<ArrayMap>>>}}:
   implements {{{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html}<<<Map>>>}}.

  All of them are annotated with
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/aspects/Immutable.html}<<<@Immutable>>>}}.

  The only dependency you need is
  (you can also download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/jcabi/jcabi-immutable/${project.version}/jcabi-immutable-${project.version}.jar}<<<jcabi-immutable-${project.version}.jar>>>}}
  and add it to the classpath):

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcabi-immutable</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
+--

Limitation

  Encapsulated objects with exposed mutators can mutate their state.

* Cutting Edge Version

  If you want to use current version of the product, you can do it with
  this configuration in your <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>oss.sonatype.org</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
    <artifactId>jcabi-immutable</artifactId>
    <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
+--
