Spf4j AVRO schema plugin.

  Use this plugin to create, build, validate, distribute, reuse data models defined by avro schemas.

  This plugin allows you to:

  * Compose data models using maven dependency framework. Use the maven release process to release and version avro data models.

  * Validate avro schemas (extensible). (documentation, naming, compatibility with previously released versions)

  * Add a unique ID to the schemas ("mvnId":"org.spf4j.avro.examples:test-schema:1.6-SNAPSHOT:6")

  * Add information to the schemas about the idl they come from ("sourceIdl":"target/avro-sources/core.avdl:50:67")

  * Generate and publish java classes.

  * Generate package and publish the avro schemas.

  ( For more on avro, see: {{{http://avro.apache.org/}avro.apache.org}} )
