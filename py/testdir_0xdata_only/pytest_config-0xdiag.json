Others ignored, saved here for sometime use. Last ip value used if duplicates? Leading _ means not used. First ip/h2o is used for H2O json communication..vary ip list to direct that. See http://docs.python.org/library/json.html for json->python data types. Note lower case for true/false. null is None, but can just not have an entry. Defaults are in h2o_hosts.py",
