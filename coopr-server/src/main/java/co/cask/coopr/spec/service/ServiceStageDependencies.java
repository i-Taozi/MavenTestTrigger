/**
 * Service stage dependencies are dependencies specific to a stage of service life. There are two types of dependencies,
 * requires and uses. If serviceA requires serviceB, placing serviceA on a cluster cannot be done without also placing
 * serviceB on the cluster. It will also enforce a specific ordering of tasks when a cluster operation plan is made.
 * For example, if serviceA requires serviceB in the install stage, the planner will make sure serviceB is installed
 * before serviceA is installed. If serviceA requires serviceB in the runtime stage, the planner will ensure that
 * serviceB is started before serviceA is initialized and started, and that serviceA is stopped before serviceB is
 * stopped. Uses is like required, except it does not enforce the presence of another service. It will just enforce
 * task ordering if the service used is present on the cluster. For example, if in the install stage, serviceC uses
 * serviceD, the planner will ensure serviceD is installed before serviceC is installed if both are on the cluster.
 * However, unlike requires, it is legal for serviceC to be placed on a cluster without serviceD. As such, there is no
 * reason for the same service to be in both the requires and uses fields, since uses is a subset of requires.
