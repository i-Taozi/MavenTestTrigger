UI Configuration

SSL Configuration Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SSL configuration requires these steps: (the first two steps are only necessary once per machine)

- Create PEM encoded SSL certificate and key
- Put the certificate and key in place (e.g. in /etc/pki/tls/certs/ and /etc/pki/tls/private/, see below)
- Set the environment variables shown below, to describe the locations
- Set and export the variables
- Correctly configure the UI (next step)


Running UI with SSL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable running the UI with SSL, set these environment variables:

==================================== ============================== =======================================
   Environment variable                     Default Value                     Description
==================================== ============================== =======================================
``COOPR_UI_KEY_FILE``                ``COOPR_HOME/cert/server.key`` Key file location
``COOPR_UI_CERT_FILE``               ``COOPR_HOME/cert/server.crt`` Certificate file location
``COOPR_SSL``                        ``true``                       Use SSL for the UI
``COOPR_UI_SSL_PORT``                ``8443``                       Port the UI listens on for connections
                                                                    (**optional**)
==================================== ============================== =======================================


.. highlight:: console

Create a file (example, ``/etc/profile.d/coopr-ui.sh``) with appropriate entries,
modifying the values as needed to point to the location of your certificate file and key,
and, optionally, a different port (``28443`` is used here as an example)::

  export COOPR_UI_KEY_FILE=/etc/pki/tls/private/ui-cert.key
  export COOPR_UI_CERT_FILE=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ui-cert.crt
  export COOPR_UI_SSL=true
  export COOPR_UI_SSL_PORT=28443


Logging into the UI with SSL Enabled
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When logging into the UI with SSL enabled, the default port is ``8443``.
You only need to set ``COOPR_UI_SSL_PORT`` if you wish to use a different port for your UI
to listen on when using SSL.
