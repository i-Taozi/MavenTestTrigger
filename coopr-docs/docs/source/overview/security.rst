===================
Security
===================

At Cask Data, we take security very seriously and invest a lot of time to make sure we
secure communication between different aspects of any system that we build.
Coopr beta release does not include a lot of much needed security features, but upcoming
releases of Coopr will make it secure and more reliable for provisioning
clusters. This document describes how we are planning to secure different aspects of
Coopr.

Communication Channels
======================

 * 1 - Browser to Coopr UI (Node.js)

  * Uses TLS/SSL.

 * 2 - User REST APIs

  * Uses TLS/SSL.

 * 3 - Coopr Server to Database

  * Uses TLS/SSL.
  * We recommend firewalling databases

 * 4 - Coopr Server to Zookeeper.

  * Uses SASL.
  * We recommend firewalling Zookeeper.

 * 5 - Coopr Server to Provisioners

  * Uses mutual authentication with TLS/SSL. 

 * 6 - Provisioners to Providers

  * Provider specific security settings.

 * 7 - Provisioners to Nodes

  * All communication is pushed from provisioner to nodes with SSH.

 * 8 - Intra-Node

  * We recommend firewalling nodes to limit cross cluster communication.  
  * Configurable firewall support included out of the box through a firewall service. 
    Different clusters can be configured differently through configuration changes when a
    cluster is requested.

Data Stores
===========

 * Zookeeper

  * Kerberos support.
  * ACLs set on znodes so only coopr user can read/write.

 * Database

  * Setup permissions so only coopr user from Coopr server hosts can read/write from the database.
  * Encryption of sensitive data.


Coopr Components
===========================

 * Coopr Server

  * Database password encryption in configuration file.
  * Integration with external user management systems like LDAP.  
  * User REST APIs require a user ID in the headers, used for authentication and authorization.
  * User REST APIs use group level ACLs on Coopr resources (providers, templates, clusters, etc) to authorize actions.
  * ACLs modifiable by admin or users with grant level access on Coopr resources. 
  * All cluster tasks are persistently stored to support audit logging of full details of all user actions and resource allocations. 

 * Coopr Provisioner

  * Encryption of provider credentials.
  * Shell provisioners only allowed to run pre-defined set of scripts and not arbitrary commands.
  * Provisioner REST APIs require mutual authentication with TLS/SSL to ensure only valid provisioners can take tasks from the server.

 * Coopr UI

  * XSS protection.
  * CSRF protection.
