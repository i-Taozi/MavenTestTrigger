=======================

Coopr was designed to simplify and unify the
process of cluster provisioning across infrastructure systems,
while still allowing the flexibility to individually
specify cluster settings.

Coopr streamlines the process of cluster provisioning, reducing
the amount of work necessary for administrators and users.
Coopr also allows cluster administrators to more easily manage and
monitor clusters through a higher level interface system.
