===========================
REST API: Cluster Templates
===========================

.. include:: /rest/rest-links.rst

The REST APIs allow you to create templates describing different types of clusters.  For example, there may be a template for Hadoop clusters, 
a template for LAMP clusters, a template for Solr clusters, etc. Templates contain enough information that a user only needs to specify a template 
and a number of machines to create a cluster. This is done by first describing the set of services, hardware types, 
and image types that a cluster is compatible with. Next, default values for provider, services, and configuration are given, with optional defaults for 
cluster-wide hardware and image type. Finally, a set of constraints are defined that describe how services, hardware, and images should be placed on a cluster.


Cluster Template Details
========================

Each cluster template configured in the system has a unique name, a short description, and a section devoted to compatibilities, defaults, and constraints.

Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A cluster template defines 3 things in its compatibility section. The first is a set of services that are compatible with the template. This means that when a user goes to create a cluster 
with this template, the user is allowed to specify any service from this set as services to place on the cluster. The system will not automatically pull in service dependencies, so the full set 
of compatible services must be defined. 

Next, a set of compatible hardware types is defined.  This means only hardware types in the compatible set can be used to create a cluster. Similarly, the compatible image types are defined, 
where only image types in the compatible set can be used to create a cluster.

Example Compatibility Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: bash

    "compatibility": {
        "hardwaretypes": [
            "small",
            "medium",
            "large"
        ],
        "imagetypes": [
            "centos6",
            "ubuntu12"
        ],
        "services": [
            "hadoop-hdfs-namenode",
            "hadoop-hdfs-datanode",
            "hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager",
            "hadoop-yarn-nodemanager",
            "zookeeper-server",
            "hbase-master",
            "hbase-regionserver",
            "reactor"
        ]
    }

Defaults
^^^^^^^^

The defaults section describes what will be used to create a cluster if the user does not specifically specify anything beyond the number of machines to use in a cluster.  Everything in 
this section can be overwritten by the user, though it is likely only advanced users will want to do so.  Templates must contain a set of default services, a default provider, and a 
default config.  Optionally, a hardware type to use across the entire cluster, and an image type to use across the entire cluster, may be specified.  The default services must be a subset 
of the services defined in the compatibility section.  Similarly, if a hardwaretype or imagetype is specified, it must be one of the types given in the compatibility section.  
A default DNS suffix can also be provided for suggested hostnames. If none is specified, the Server will use "local" as the DNS suffix.
Lastly, the config is a JSON Object that gets passed straight through to provisioners, usually describing different configuration settings for the services that will be placed on the cluster.

                },
                "hdfs_site": {
                    "dfs.datanode.max.xcievers": "4096"
                },
                "mapred_site": {
                    "mapreduce.framework.name": "yarn"
                },
                "yarn_site": {
                    "yarn.resourcemanager.hostname": "%host.service.hadoop-yarn-resourcemanager%"
                }
            },
            "hbase": {
                "hbase_site": {
                    "hbase.rootdir": "hdfs://%host.service.hadoop-hdfs-namenode%/hbase",
                    "hbase.cluster.distributed": "true",
                    "hbase.zookeeper.quorum": "%join(map(host.service.zookeeper-server,'$:2181'),',')%"
                }
            }
        }
    }

Constraints
^^^^^^^^^^^
Templates can define 3 types of constraints -- size, layout, and service.

Size constraints determine how many nodes a cluster can have. Currently, a minimum and maximum can be defined. If no minimum is defined, a minimum of 1 node will be used.
If no maximum is defined, there is no maximum. The maximum must be greater than or equal to the minimum.

Layout constraints define which services must and can't coexist on the same node.  Must coexist constraints are given as an array of arrays. 
Each inner array is a set of services that must all coexist together on the same node.  For example, in a hadoop cluster, you generally want datanodes, regionservers, 
and nodemanagers to all be placed together. To achieve this cloistered coexistancy, you would put all 3 services in the same "must coexist" constraint.  Must coexist constraints 
are not transitive. If there is one constraint saying serviceA must coexist with serviceB, and another constraint saying serviceB must coexist with serviceC, this does NOT mean 
that serviceA must coexist with serviceC. It was designed this way to prevent unintended links between services, especially as the number of must coexist constraints increase.
If a must coexist rule contains a service that is not on the cluster, it is shrunk to ignore the service that is not on the cluster. For example, your template may be compatible with 
datanodes, nodemanagers, and regionservers. However, by default, you only put datanodes and nodemanagers on the cluster. A constraint stating that datanodes, nodemanagers, and 
regionservers must coexist on the same node will get transformed into a constraint that just says datanodes and nodemanagers must coexist on the same node.

The other type of layout constraint are can't coexist constraints, which are also given as an array of arrays. Each inner array is a set of services that cannot all 
coexist together on the same node.  For example, in a hadoop cluster, you generally do not want your namenode to be on the same node as a datanode.  Specifying more 
than 2 services in a can't coexist rule means the entire set cannot exist on the same node. For example, if there is a constraint that serviceA, serviceB, and serviceC can't
coexist, serviceA and serviceB can still coexist on the same node.  Though supported, this can be confusing, so the best practice is to keep the can't coexist constraints binary.  
Anything not mentioned in the must or can't coexist constraints are allowed. 

Service constraints are defined as a JSON Object containing optional hardware types, image types, and quantities for a service that can be placed on the cluster.  Keys in the JSON Object 
are service names, and values are JSON Objects representing the service constraint.  A service constraint can contain a key named hardwaretypes, with a corresponding JSON array of 
hardware types that the service can be placed on.  Any node with that service must use one of the hardware types in the array.  If nothing is given, the service can go on a node with any 
type of hardware.  Similarly, a service constraint can contain a key named imagetypes, with a corresponding JSON array of image types that the service can be placed on.  Any node with 
that service must use one of the image types in the array.  If nothing is given, the service can go on a node with any type of image.  A service constraint can also limit the quantities 
of that service across the entire cluster.  These are specified with a quantities key, whose corresponding value is a JSON Object.  The JSON Object can optionally contain a key for min 
and an integer for the minimum number of nodes that must contain the service across the entire cluster.  Similarly, a max can be given to limit the maximum number of nodes with the service 
on the cluster.

            }
        }
    }


Administration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The administration section describes elements for managing clusters. The lease duration of clusters is defined in this
section. Lease duration is composed of three components: the initial lease duration, the maximum lease duration, and the
step size of incrementing the lease duration. For each of these variables, zero values denote special cases. For
initial lease duration, a zero value specifies that clusters created will have an unlimited lease duration. A zero max
represents that the lease duration a cluster can be extended to any amount of time. A zero step size signifies that
increments of lease duration can be of any value.

Example Administration Section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: bash

    "administration": {
        "leaseduration": {
            "initial":172800000,
            "max":864000000,
            "step":86400000
        }
