In addition to the standard REST endpoints, a few RPC functions are available.

.. _rpc-properties:

Get Properties of Nodes in a Cluster
====================================

The next RPC call gets node properties for nodes in a cluster belonging to the caller. 
The properties fetched can be whitelisted. Nodes returned can also be filtered so that
only nodes containing a specific list of services are returned. To get a list of node
properties from a cluster, make a POST HTTP request to URI: 
::

 /getNodeProperties

The POST body must contain the ``clusterId``. Optionally it can include an array of 
``properties``, containing a list of properties to return. Properties include 
``hostname``, ``ipaddress`` as well as anything else the Provisioners place there.
Optionally the POST body can also contain an array of ``services``. Doing so will 
restrict the result to only contain properties from nodes that have all services
in the list. The response is a JSON Object mapping node id to its properties.  

POST Parameters
