   single: REST API: Provisioner Plugins 

=============================
REST API: Provisioner Plugins
=============================

.. include:: /rest/rest-links.rst

Using the admin REST API, you can upload and manage plugin resources.
Each tenant admin can upload resources that plugins can use, such as chef cookbooks
or shell scripts. There are two types of plugins: automator and provider. Automator 
plugins are responsible for performing service operations, such as installing or
starting a service on a node. Provider plugins are responsible for node operations
such as creating and deleting a node through a cloud provider like Openstack. 

Plugin specifications are defined by the author of the plugin, and are registered with
the server once upon installation of the plugin.

.. _plugin-spec-all-list:

Retrieve a plugin specification
===============================

To retrieve the specification for a specific plugin, make a HTTP GET request to URI:
::

 /plugins/{plugin-type}/{plugin-name}

Plugin type is either automatortypes or providertypes. The plugin name and specification
is defined by the plugin author. For example, one of the automator plugins that comes
with the system is the chef-solo plugin. 

HTTP Responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The response is a JSON Object with ``name``, ``description``, ``resourcetypes``, and ``parameters`` as keys. 
The name is unique within the plugin type and tenant. 

Parameters define what fields the plugin needs to
perform actions and whether the parameters should come from the admin or user. For provider plugins, admin
parameters are given when creating a provider of the given provider type. For example, when creating 
an openstack provider, the admin may need to supply an API url. For provider plugins, user parameters 
are given when a cluster is being created. For automator plugins, admin fields are given when creating or 
editing services. For example, when defining how a service should be started with the chef-solo plugin, the
admin must provide a run_list parameter.

Resource types define what types of resources the plugin can use. For example, the chef-solo plugin can use
cookbooks, databags, and roles. Each resource type specifies the type of file the resource is, which must be
either file or archive. Resources of each type can be uploaded and managed through the resource APIs.

.. _plugin-spec-retrieve:

==================================

To retrieve all specifications of a given plugin type, make a GET HTTP request to URI:
::

 /plugins/{plugin-type}

Plugin type is either automatortypes or providertypes.

HTTP Responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The response is a JSON Array of plugin specifications. If no plugins are present, an empty array is returned.

           "parameters": { ... }
       },
       ...
   ]

.. _plugin-resource-create:

Add a plugin resource
=====================

To add a plugin resource, make a HTTP POST request to URI:
::

 /plugins/{plugin-type}/{plugin-name}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}

Plugin type is automatortypes or providertypes, plugin name is the name of the plugin, and resource type 
is one of the resource types defined in the plugin specification. The resource name is the name of 
the resource. The POST body contains the binary contents of the resource.

.. note:: If you are uploading an archive, the top level directory of your unpacked archive must be named exactly the same as your resource name. For example, if you are uploading an archive of a directory named 'mycookbook', you *must* name your resource 'mycookbook' in order for it to be used correctly. This issue will be fixed in the next release.

HTTP Responses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Metadata for the resource is returned in the response body. The response is a JSON Object that contains the resource
name, version, and status. The status will be one of "inactive", "active", "staged", or "recalled". An inactive resource
is one that has been added to the system, but which is not in use by provisioners. An active resource is one that is 
current in use by provisioners. A staged resource is one that is not currently in use by provisioners, but which will be 
pushed to and used by provisioners after the next sync call. A recalled resource is one that is currently in use by
provisioners, but which will be removed from use after the next sync call.

=======================================

Tenant admins can stage a specific version of a resource by making a HTTP POST request to URI:
::

 /plugins/{plugin-type}/{plugin-name}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}/versions/{version}/stage

Staging a resource will make it so that the next sync call will push the resource version to the provisioners.
Staging an active or staged resource will not do anything. Staging a recalled resource will put it back in the active
state.

========================================

Tenant admins can recall a specific version of a resource by making a HTTP POST request to URI:
::

 /plugins/{plugin-type}/{plugin-name}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}/versions/{version}/recall

Recalling a resource will make it so that the next sync call will remove that resource version from use.
Recalling an inactive or recalled resource version will have no effect. Recalling a staged resource puts it
back in the inactive state and recalling an active resource puts it in the recalled state.
