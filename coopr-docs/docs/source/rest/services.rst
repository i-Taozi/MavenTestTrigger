   single: REST API: Services

==================
REST API: Services
==================

.. include:: /rest/rest-links.rst

The REST APIs allow the administrator to add services. A service is some piece of software
that can be placed on a cluster. Examples include a mysql server, a Hadoop namenode, a 
Lucene indexer, and much more. The administrator defines the service entirely, so any software
supported by the underlying provisioners can be added. By writing a provisioner
automator plugin, or by using the included chef-solo and shell plugins, an administrator can manage
any service they want.

A service is uniquely identified by its name. It also contains a short description and a section for
provisioner information and a section for its dependencies. The provisioner and dependencies sections
are described in more detail below.  

Provisioner
^^^^^^^^^^^

The provisioner section contains any information the provisioner may need to 
carry out actions related to the service. Service actions include INSTALL,
CONFIGURE, INITIALIZE, START, STOP, and REMOVE. The administrator needs to 
add any relevant actions for a service. For example, it is possible to have a
service that only installs and configures, but does none of the other actions.
For that service, the administrator would need to add 2 actions for the service,
and choose which automator type will be used to carry out that action. Depending
on the automator type, different fields may need to be provided. Required fields
are defined by the automator type, which is given by the plugin itself.

The provisioner section itself is a JSON object with ``actions`` as a key, and a
JSON object as its value.  The value contains a mapping of service action 
(one of install, configure, initialize, start, stop, and remove) to 
automator details. The automator details is a JSON object containing a ``type``,
which defines which automator type to use for that action, and ``fields``. Fields
contains another JSON object which is a set of key-value pairs required by the 
automator plugin.

This example is taken from an example Hadoop namenode service. It uses chef-solo as the 
automator type, which requires a run_list field and also allows an optional json_attributes field.

.. code-block:: bash

  "provisioner": {
    "actions": {
        "configure": {
            "type": "chef-solo",
            "fields": {
                "run_list": "recipe[hadoop_wrapper::default],recipe[hadoop::default]"
            }
        },
        "initialize": {
            "type": "chef-solo",
            "fields": {
                "run_list": "recipe[hadoop_wrapper::hadoop_hdfs_namenode_init]"
            }
        },
        "install": {
            "type": "chef-solo",
            "fields": {
                "run_list": "recipe[hadoop::hadoop_hdfs_namenode]"
            }
        },
        "start": {
            "type": "chef-solo",
            "fields": {
                "json_attributes": "{\"coopr\": { \"node\": { \"services\": { \"hadoop-hdfs-namenode\": \"start\" } } } }",
                "run_list": "recipe[hadoop_wrapper::default],recipe[hadoop::hadoop_hdfs_namenode],recipe[coopr_service_runner::default]"
            }
        },
        "stop": {
            "type": "chef-solo",
            "fields": {
                "json_attributes": "{\"coopr\": { \"node\": { \"services\": { \"hadoop-hdfs-namenode\": \"stop\" } } } }",
                "run_list": "recipe[hadoop_wrapper::default],recipe[hadoop::hadoop_hdfs_namenode],recipe[coopr_service_runner::default]"
            }
        }
    }

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dependencies serve two general purposes. The first is to enforce that a service
cannot be placed onto a cluster without also placing the services it requires. The second is to enforce a safe
ordering of service actions while performing cluster operations. It is easiest to understand the different
types of dependencies by going through example. In this example we have a service called "myapp-2.0". 

.. code-block:: bash

    "dependencies": {
        "provides": [ "myapp" ],
        "conflicts": [ "myapp-1.0", "myapp-1.5" ],
        "install": {
            "requires": [ "base" ],
            "uses": [ "ntp" ]
        },
        "runtime": {
            "requires": [ "sql-db" ],
            "uses": [ "load-balancer" ]
        }
    }

Conflicts
^^^^^^^^^
The ``conflicts`` key specifies an array of services that cannot be placed on a cluster with the given service.
In this example, that means that "myapp-2.0" cannot be placed on a cluster with "myapp-1.0" or "myapp-1.5".

Install
^^^^^^^
Install defines install time dependencies. Install time dependencies take effect for the INSTALL and REMOVE
service actions. It contains a ``requires`` key which specifies an array of services that the given services
requires for its installation. In this example, "myapp-2.0" *requires* the "base" service at install time. This
means that the installation of the "base" service will occur before the install of the "myapp-2.0" service. Similarly,
the removal of the "myapp-2.0" service will occur before the removal of the "base" service. This also means that
the "myapp-2.0" service cannot be placed on a cluster without the "base" service also being placed on the cluster.
The ``uses`` key is like the ``requires`` key in that it enforces the same ordering of service actions. However,
``uses`` will not enforce the presence of the dependent service. In this example, "myapp-2.0" *uses* the "ntp" service
at install time. This means that if the "ntp" service is also on the cluster, the installation of "ntp" will occur
before the installation of "myapp-2.0". However, "ntp" does not have to be placed on the cluster in order for "myapp-2.0"
to be placed on the cluster.

Runtime
^^^^^^^
Runtime defines run time dependencies. It also contains ``requires`` and ``uses`` keys that are analagous to those
in the install section. The only difference is the service actions that they apply to. Install dependencies affect
the INSTALL and REMOVE service actions, whereas runtime dependencies affect the INITIALIZE, START, and STOP service actions.
In this example, "myapp-2.0" *requires* the "sql-db" service. This means that "myapp-2.0" cannot be placed on a cluster
without a "sql-db" service. It also means that the initialization of "myapp-2.0" will occur after the start of "sql-db".
It also means the start of "myapp-2.0" will occur after the start of "sql-db" and that the stop of "myapp-2.0" 
will occur before the stop of "sql-db". Similarly, because "myapp-2.0" *uses* "load-balancer", initialization and start of
"myapp-2.0" will occur after the start of "load-balancer". Similarly, the stop of "myapp-2.0" will occur before the stop
of "load-balancer". Since it is in ``uses``, enforcement of this ordering only applies if "load-balancer" is present on the
same cluster as "myapp-2.0". The "myapp-2.0" service can be placed on a cluster without the "load-balancer" service.

Provides
^^^^^^^^
The provides section provides an extra level of indirection when specifying dependencies. In this example, the "myapp-2.0" 
service provides the "myapp" service. This means that other services can put "myapp" in their runtime or install dependencies,
and "myapp-2.0" will satisfy that dependency. As another example, "myapp-2.0" *requires* the "sql-db" service. If there was a
service called "mysql-db" that provides "sql-db", then it would be fine for "mysql-db" and "myapp-2.0" to be on the same 
cluster. All the ordering enforced by that runtime *requires* dependency would be enforced between the "myapp-2.0" and "mysql-db"
services.
 
.. _service-create:

Add a Service
==================

To create a new services, make a HTTP POST request to URI:
::

 /services

The POST body must contain a unique ``name``, and a ``provisioner`` section
describing how provisioner automators should carry out service actions. 
Optionally, a ``description`` can be given describing the service, and a 
``dependencies`` section can be given, describing other services that the 
service depends on.
