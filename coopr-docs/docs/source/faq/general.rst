.. _faq-general-1:

What are the differences between Coopr and Ambari/Savanna?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

From the `Apache Ambari <http://ambari.apache.org/>`_ site:

.. epigraph:: "The Apache Ambari project is aimed at making Hadoop management simpler by developing software for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop clusters. Ambari provides an intuitive, easy-to-use Hadoop management web UI backed by its RESTful APIs."

From the `Savanna <https://savanna.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ site:

.. epigraph:: "Savanna project aims to provide users with simple means to provision a Hadoop cluster at OpenStack by specifying several parameters like Hadoop version, cluster topology, nodes hardware details..."

Even though Coopr may seem similar to Apache Ambari and Savanna in some aspects, it is vastly different in terms of functionality and system capabilities.

The graph above depicts Coopr's management capabilities on the horizontal scale, and the table below differentiates the high level features absent in Apache Ambari and Savanna:

   * - Feature
     - Coopr
     - Ambari/Savanna
     - Description
   * - Multi Cluster support
     - Y
     - N
     - Ambari/Savanna offers limited support in the backend, and Ambari limits to single cluster in the frontend
   * - Private or Public Cloud support
     - Y
     - N
     - No provisioning capability in Ambari; Savanna supports provisioning, but both are limited only to Hadoop clusters
   * - Support for other OS
     - Y 
     - N
     - Only supports RHEL and SuSE; More information `AMBARI-1241 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-1241>`_ and `AMBARI-660 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-660>`_
   * - Support any distribution of Hadoop 
     - Y
     - N
     - Ambari only supports HDP, `AMBARI-3524 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-3524>`_
   * - Support for any automation system
     - Y
     - N
     - Ambari only supports Puppet; Coopr can support any automation framework through :doc:`Provisioner Plugins </guide/superadmin/plugins>`
   * - Cluster template support 
     - Y
     - Y/N
     - Ambari supports blueprints after the cluster is available for further management. Unlike Coopr, it does not use templates to create clusters. Savanna, on the other hand, does support, but it requires node groups to be explicitly defined for placing services on each node group. Coopr offers a built-in logic for solving the service placement through a layout planner.
   * - Consistency Guarantees
     - Y
     - N
     - Ambari does not guarantee consistency in case of failures during provisioning. In contrast, Coopr layout planner DAG executioner ensures consistency by transacting operations on the cluster.

.. _faq-general-2:

Does Coopr work with Ambari?
---------------------------------------
Currently there is no integration with Ambari. There are plans to add a feature for Coopr to export templates that are compatible with Apache Ambari blueprints. When this compatibility feature is
completed in Ambari, you may be able to work with these templates. Please refer to `AMBARI-1783 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMBARI-1783>`_ for more information.

.. _faq-general-3:

What are the differences between Coopr and Amazon EMR?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon EMR provides a subset of Hadoop services (such as Hive, Pig, HBase, and MapReduce) and manages 
jobs and workflows on top of those services. Coopr, on the other hand, is a software agnostic, generic system for
creating clusters of any layout and of any type. Being software agnostic and a provisioning tool, Coopr has no direct support
for managing jobs on clusters, as its focus is on cluster creation and management, not jobs and workflow management.

.. _faq-general-4:

Will Coopr support Docker based clusters?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We believe in the potential of `Docker <http://docker.io>`_ based clusters. In the future releases, we plan to support Docker based clusters.

.. _faq-general-5:

Does Coopr support bare metal?
------------------------------------------
Not at the moment, but there are plans to add resource pools in a future release. With resource pools, Coopr would manage
pre-existing machines instead of creating them from scratch each time a new node is needed. Resource pools would also
introduce the ability to manage bare metal. Enterprise users with existing hardware procurements systems can write a provisioner
plugin to interface with their existing systems.

.. _faq-general-6:

What providers are supported by Coopr?
-------------------------------------------------
Out of the box, Coopr supports Amazon Web Services (EC2), DigitalOcean, Google Compute Engine, Joyent, OpenStack (and compatible), and Rackspace.
Plugins for HP Cloud, Cloudstack, BlueBox, CloudFoundry, IBM SoftLayer, and Terremark are planned. Contributions here are welcome and encouraged!

.. _faq-general-7:

Does Coopr make it easy for me to migrate from one cloud to another?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Absolutely. When we originally built Coopr at Cask Data, the main goal was to make it a seamless process to migrate from
one cloud to another.

.. _faq-general-8:

Can Coopr work on my laptop?
----------------------------------------
Coopr has been tested on OS X Mavericks and Linux. There are plans to add Windows support in a future release, but until then
Windows users will have to use the usual workarounds, such as using Cygwin.

.. _faq-general-9:

How long has Coopr been used in a production environment and where is it being used?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A previous version of Coopr has been running in production at Cask Data since Feb 2012.

.. _faq-general-10:

Is Coopr designed only for provisioning compute and storage?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coopr is a generic provisioning coordination system, and it can be used for provisioning more than
just compute and storage. Though Coopr has not yet been tested, the architecture supports provisioning
and configuring of other resources. Please refer to the :doc:`Provisioner Plugins</guide/superadmin/plugins>` page
for more details on how to write plugins for provisioners to support Providers and Automators that can provision and 
configure different resources.

.. _faq-general-11:

What is the recommended setup for Coopr in terms of hardware and configuration?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We recommend the following :doc:`deployment configuration </guide/recommended-deployment>` for a production environment that includes
HA for persistent store, multiple nodes for Zookeeper, and HAProxy for traffic distribution across UIs and servers.

.. _faq-general-12:

Does Coopr support monitoring and alerting of services deployed?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Currently, it does not; however, another system within Cask named Mensa (a monitoring and alerting system) is being integrated
into Coopr to support monitoring and alerting.

.. _faq-general-13:

Does Coopr support metering?
---------------------------------------
For each account, and the templates from which it provisions resources, Coopr internally keeps track of clusters, resources, and services. This information
will be exposed through the administration interface in the next release.

.. _faq-general-14:

I use Puppet. Will I be able to use Puppet with Coopr?
------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Coopr is a smart orchestration layer with open support for integrating any automation framework. You can use your Puppet modules
to configure clusters. Please refer to the :doc:`Administration Guide </guide/admin/index>` for more details on how to integrate.

.. _faq-general-15:

Can Coopr support approval workflows or the ability to pause provisioning for approval?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The current version of Coopr does not support it, but it will be very easy to add a cluster provisioning state for approval or pausing.
