===================

Welcome to Coopr 0.9.7 release. Release notes with links to issue details can be seen from the github project at https://github.com/cdapio/coopr/releases.

Release Theme : Extensibility 
--------------------------------

Release Highlights
------------------
  * Plugin registration to support surfacing of plugin-defined fields for configuring providers and automators
  * Finer grained dependencies for service life-cycle hooks. This allows specifying install time, runtime, and optional dependencies. E.g. You may want some service X to be installed before service Y, or start service X after service Y but only if service Y is installed on the cluster
  * Life-cycle callbacks for clusters for integrating with enterprise assets (e.g. Metering, Monitoring, ...)
  * Ability to add additional configured services to an existing live cluster. (e.g. Create a Hadoop cluster with only HDFS and MapReduce and then later installing HBase on the cluster)
  * Support for starting, stopping and restarting services 
  * Personalizable UI skins
  * More out-of-box cookbooks

    * Apache Hive(tm) support for clusters
    * Enable a secure cluster with support for Kerberos

  * Lot of bug fixes
  * Lot of testing
