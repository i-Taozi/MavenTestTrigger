Client Details 
The KnoxShell release artifact provides a small footprint client environment
that removes all unnecessary server dependencies, configuration, binary scripts,
etc. It is comprised a couple different things that empower different sorts of users.

 - A set of SDK type classes for providing access to Hadoop resources over HTTP
 - A Groovy based DSL for scripting access to Hadoop resources based on the underlying SDK classes
 - A KnoxShell Token based Sessions to provide a CLI SSO session for executing multiple scripts
