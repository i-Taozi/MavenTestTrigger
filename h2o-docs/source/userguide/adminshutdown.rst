Admin Shutdown
=================

When you have finished running an H2O instance, exit by selecting **Shutdown** from the drop-down **Admin** menu. 

If you close the browser window running the H2O instance without explicitly stopping H2O, the cluster associated with the H2O instance persists and resources are still allocated to H2O. You can return to the browser-based interface at any time and access all of the prior jobs within that H2O instance. 

To completely quit an H2O instance and release the resources allocated for H2O, use **Shutdown** to stop the cluster.
